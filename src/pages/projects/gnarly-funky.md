title: Gnarly Funky
description: >-
  Gnarly Funky was a small exercise in dungeon-generation by 4 engineers. It
  features randomly generated room names and descriptions, a chat room, and
  tracking of player positions.
responsibilities: >-
  I was the primary contributor on the UI design for Gnarly Funky. I also wrote
  the algorithm for generating rooms. The dungeon is generated by using weighted
  odds to walk out from the center of a 2D array and generate links between
  rooms. The process is repeated a number of times, creating a dense
  interconnected center and lengthy branches out in each direction.
