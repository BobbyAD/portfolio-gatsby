description: >-
  My portfolio was built using GatsbyJS. Even though it's fairly simple, it
  serves as an example of a project intended to be easily edited and maintained
  for its lifetime.
responsibilities: >-
  I chose Gatsby primarily for its SEO features and ease of integration in to a
  CMS. Content can easily be edited or added without needing to touch source
  code via NetlifyCMS. Gatsby also provides a vehicle for me to practice GraphQL
  and React on a regular basis.
