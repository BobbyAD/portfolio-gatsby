about: >-
  I am a Full Stack Developer with years of design experience. Whether it's
  deciding on what colors or shapes to use in a design, how to write a certain
  algorithm, or just solving puzzles in my free time, I enjoy problem solving. I
  primarily work in React, Node, and Java when writing apps.
