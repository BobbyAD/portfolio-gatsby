  Hi, I'm Bobby. After years of working as a texture artist, I made the
  transition to full-stack development. My art experience allows me to not only
  work on the full code stack of an app, but also the design. At the moment I
  use React mostly for front end, and Java or Firestore for back end. However,
  I'm constantly learning new things, so each new project tends to incorporate
  new frameworks or technologies. 


  Follow me on Github or LinkedIn to keep up with my work.
