  Hi, I'm Bobby. After years of working as a texture artist, I made the
  transition to web development. At the moment I use React mostly for front end,
  and Java or Firestore for a backend, but I'm constantly learning new things
  and working on new projects. \n \n Follow me on Github or LinkedIn to keep up
  with my work.
